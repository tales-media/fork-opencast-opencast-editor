The Opencast Video Editor is a tool included by [Opencast](https://opencast.org) to cut and arrange recordings.


Quick Test
----------

To test locally, run:

    npm start

This will start a local test server in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The latest version connected to [develop.opencast.org](https://develop.opencast.org) is also publicly available
at [editor.opencast.org](https://editor.opencast.org).

To open a specific event with the editor, use the GET-Parameter `id` like so: `https://editor.opencast.org/?id=27cd7156-fda6-4b31-aab5-d56833012caf`.


Building the Editor
-------------------

To build the editor for production to the `build` folder, run:

    npm run build

To make the editor work in a sub-path, use:

    PUBLIC_URL=/path npm run build

To build a container image, run:

    DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build \
        --build-arg NODE_VERSION=16 \
        --build-arg CADDY_VERSION=2.5.1 \
        --build-arg PUBLIC_URL=/ \
        --build-arg VITE_APP_SETTINGS_PATH=/editor-settings.toml \
        -t quay.io/opencast/editor .

Configuration
-------------


### Configuration Methods

Most configuration options can be set either as an option in the configuration file or as a URL parameter.

The configuration file is called `editor-settings.toml`. It can either be provided in the public folder when running locally or can be found under `etc/opencast/ui-config/mh_default_org/editor` when deployed in Opencast. More information can be found in the example configuration file.

If a configuration option belongs to a section, URL parameters are a combination of section and option separated by a single dot.

For example, the following option in the configuration file:

```toml
[trackSelection]
show = true
```

…can be specified as URL parameter in the form `trackSelection.show=true`.

If an option can be specified both ways, the URL parameter will always take precedence.


### Settings

Options which are usually specified in the configuration file are documented in there as well. Metadata configuration options are only documented in the configuration file.

How to cut a release for Opencast with the Github UI
----------------------------------------------------

1. (Optional) Run the [Update translations](https://github.com/opencast/opencast-editor/actions/workflows/update-translations.yml) workflow, to make sure all changes from crowdin are included in the next release.

2. Run the [Create release tag](https://github.com/opencast/opencast-editor/actions/workflows/create-release.yml)
   workflow to create a correctly named tag in the appropriate branch.  When running the workflow via the dropdown
   ensure you select the correct branch for the release!
    - This will create the tag in the forman N.x-YYYY-MM-DD

3. Wait for the [Process release](https://github.com/opencast/opencast-editor/actions/workflows/process-release.yml)
   workflow to finish
    - It will create a new [GitHub release](https://github.com/opencast/opencast-editor/releases)
      - Review the release and make sure the notes are right, update them if not.
        - By selecting the previous release, Github can generate release notes automatically
      - This review isn't required to happen prior to the next step!

5. Merge the upstream issue that the workflow above filed in [Opencast's main repository](https://github.com/opencast/opencast)


Editor releases
---------------

The editor module no longer cuts releases itself.  Opencast's release manager will create tags as appropriate and push
as part of the release process.


Opencast API used by the Editor
-------------

The editor accesses the following endpoints in Opencast:

* `/editor/<mediaPackageId>/edit.json`      (introduced in OC 9.3)
* `/editor/<mediaPackageId>/metadata.json`  (introduced in OC 9.4)

If you want to use current editor frontend with an earlier Opencast version, you will have to cherry pick the relevant commits from the Opencast repository yourself.


Translating the Editor
-------------
You can help translating the editor to your language on [crowdin.com/project/opencast-editor](https://crowdin.com/project/opencast-editor). Simply request to join the project on Crowdin and start translating. If you are interested in translating a language which is not a target language right now, please create [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/opencast/opencast-editor/issues) and we will add the language.

This project follows the general form of [Opencast's Localization Process](https://docs.opencast.org/develop/developer/#participate/localization/), especially regarding what happens when you need to [change an existing translation key](https://docs.opencast.org/develop/developer/#participate/localization/#i-need-to-update-the-wording-of-the-source-translation-what-happens).  Any questions not answered there should be referred to the mailing lists!

Notes on Waveform Generation
----------------------------

The editor displays a waveform image on the timeline in the cutting view. This waveform image is generated at runtime
from one of the videos of the event. However, to properly generate the image, the video it is generated from needs to be
loaded completely once, which takes time and bandwidth. If this poses a problem for your use case, you can instead have
Opencast provide an image in the internal publication. Provided images will always take precedence and prevent the
generation algorithm form running. The provided image should have the same flavor that is specified in the Opencast
configuration file `etc/org.opencastproject.editor.EditorServiceImpl.cfg`.
